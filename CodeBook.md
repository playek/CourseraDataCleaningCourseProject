## Introduction

This file describes the data, the variables, and the work that has been performed to clean up the data.

### Data Set Description

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

#### Following observations are  provided:

* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.

* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.

* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.

* Its activity label.
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

####  following files are provoded as input data set

* features_info.txt: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

* features.txt: List of all features.

* activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.

* train/X_train.txt: Training set.

* train/y_train.txt: Training labels.

* test/X_test.txt: Test set.

* test/y_test.txt: Test labels.

* train/subject_train.txt: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

* train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

* train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

* train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

### Features selection

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

### Transformations

the following steps are performed to build tidy  data set.

* read X, y and subject data for both train and test datasets

* read in features descriptions

* set descriptive names for all columns in x data set from fature description read above for both training and test data

* set descriptive names for  y ( activity) and subject data for both training and test data

* join x, y and subject data into a single table for test using column binding

* join x, y and subject data into a single table for training using  column binding

* merge training and test tables into a single one using row binding.

* summarize means per unique (activity, subject) pair

*  Creates  tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* write the tidy data set into a file
